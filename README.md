# jrobertson.io - Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio, built with **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. I host it on **Vercel**, which makes deployments fast and seamless. You can check it out live at [jrobertson.io](https://jrobertson.io).

I created this site to share my projects, my journey into software engineering, and a bit of my personality as I continue to grow in the field.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - my go-to React framework for building modern, fast sites  
- **Tailwind CSS** - utility-first styling that lets me move quickly  
- **Vercel** - deployment made simple  
- **React Components** - reusable and dynamic building blocks  
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - depending on the section I am working on  

---

## ✨ What I Built

I designed this portfolio to be clean, responsive, and easy to update. Some highlights:

- Fully responsive design that looks good on any screen  
- Smooth navigation thanks to Next.js routing  
- A home for my projects, blog posts, and experiments  
- SEO-friendly structure so I can rank for my name and work  
- Auto-deployments via GitHub -> Vercel, so updates go live when I push to `main`

## 📦 Deployment

This portfolio is deployed on **Vercel**. Any changes pushed to the `main` branch are automatically built and deployed. Preview deployments are created for pull requests so I can review changes before merging.

## 🎯 My Goals

This site is not just a portfolio. It is a playground where I practice building, iterating, and experimenting. I wanted a central spot to:

- Showcase projects I am proud of  
- Share what I have been learning along the way  
- Build a strong personal brand as I grow in software engineering  

---

## 📝 What I Learned

Building this portfolio taught me more than I expected:

- How to use **Next.js** effectively for both static and server-side rendering  
- How much time **Tailwind** saves once you really get comfortable with it  
- The power of **CI/CD** when every push to GitHub automatically deploys to Vercel   
- That a personal site is never really finished. It keeps evolving as I grow
