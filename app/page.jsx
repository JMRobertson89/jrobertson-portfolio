						Hi! I'm Josh, a Full-Stack Software Developer with a passion for
						creating meaningful, user-focused applications that bring ideas to
						life. I'm motivated by solving complex problems, designing solutions
						that are both functional and intuitive, and seeing the direct impact
						of my work on people and organizations. My approach blends
						creativity with analytical thinking, allowing me to adapt quickly
						and thrive in fast-moving environments.
					</Reveal>
					<Reveal as="p">
						Before transitioning into software engineering, I built a career in
						technology sales and account management. That background sharpened
						my ability to understand client needs, communicate effectively
						across teams, and deliver solutions that create real business
						impact. Now, I apply that same mindset to engineering challenges by
						bridging technical execution with user and stakeholder priorities.
					</Reveal>
					<Reveal as="p">
						Iâ€™m driven to transform ideas into impactful software solutions that
						solve real-world problems and create meaningful experiences for
						users. I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and
						creativity are encouraged, and I'm always eager to learn,
						experiment, and grow as a developer. Whether it's building scalable
						systems, refining user interfaces, or exploring new technologies,
						I'm passionate about pushing projects forward. Let's connect and
						create something remarkable together!
